## Challenge instructions

Create a responsive single page app that is based on Gmail's web interface. Make any improvements to the UX that you see fit. This is intended to show your knowledge of Javascript (vanilla JS or any framework of your choice) & CSS/Sass/Less, while also showing your grasp of UI/UX best practices.

Use the following guidelines when building the application:

Uses color scheme similar to that of Gmail
Displays a list of emails with name, title, date and tags based on provided emails.json file
Allows for selection of one or more emails by the end user
Allows users to perform a number of actions on one or more selected emails
Shows a sidebar that displays a number of tags
Table cells should be viewable at all resolutions above 320px
Include at least one javascript test
Spend time on both the UI/UX and the actual functionality of the list view. This view should be as complete as possible without interacting with a backend data service, so look at stubbing out fake data.

Try to time box this exercise to take no longer than 4 hours. If you don't feel like you're able to finish within that timeframe, focus on making parts of the exercise great rather than submitting a project that's 80% complete across the board. This gives engineers an opportunity to explore what it's like to work with you while we're fleshing out the remaining work or expanding on it.

Also, please don't use this an an opportunity to learn a new framework - instead, use tools and technologies you are comfortable with so we can have an in-depth discussion about your decisions and approach.
